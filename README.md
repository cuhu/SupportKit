# DreamrSupportKit

## About 
For a user of iOS, getting help and giving feedback to developers isn’t easy. The developer first needs to have a support facility within their app and the user has to feel like the feedback they’re giving is going to get listened to.

Guidance by Dreamr helps to solve this problem.

Users can give feedback to the app they use, and get directed to the app store if it’s a positive experience. If it’s not they get directed to give feedback to the developer, without even seeing the AppStore, which could result in negative reviews.

Guidance was created to help guide a user to getting the right support, when they need it. Users cannot get support on the AppStore, which is where Guidance steps in.

## Example
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements
Compatibible with iOS 9.0 and up

## Installation
DreamrKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
